> [!NOTE]
> `Cross`, `MacOS`, `Linux`, and `Windows` platform tags refers to apps with an executable or binary, EX: exe and dmg (with the exception of CLI apps). `Selfhosted` apps are often inherently cross platform via docker desktop but they aren't labeled as such. The same goes for apps installed via `pip` and `npm`. A few apps blur the lines with convoluted options to install/ This is prevalent in AI apps. These can have misleading platform tags - we are working on a solution.
